# Learning Git and Github!

## Sub-Headline

Version control is an essential skill for developers to master, and **Git** is by far the most popular version control system on the web. In this `fast-paced` course, you will learn how to install Git and use the fundamental commands you need to work with Git projects: moving files, managing logs, and working with branches.

Plus, you'll [learn]() how to work with the popular **GitHub** website to explore existing projects, clone them to your local hard drive, and use them as templates for your new projects.
